gTube is the working name of a youtube replacement with a few differences. Uploading will be done
through accounts with an option to post anon. Comments will be done the same way with anon as
default.

A key part will be a listing of recent videos in categories much like 4chans boards, after a
video reaches bump limit or past the last page it will remain active and able to be linked to, as 
well as being listed in the op's channel.

Still unsure about anon videos, they would have to be posted from an account with an anon option
on upload. This makes moderation easier.
